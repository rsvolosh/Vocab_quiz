Vocabulary Practice Quiz Generator

This is a tool to help you memorise the definitions of words. In a nutshell, 
you add words and their relevant definitions to your personalised dictionary, 
and then you take a multiple-choice quiz on those words, where, if you pick the correct 
answer, it will say "Correct!" and no longer ask you for the definition of that 
word; and if you pick the incorrect answer, it will tell you you're wrong and 
ask you to define that word again at some point in the quiz. The quiz ends only 
once you correctly define all the words in your dictionary, or when you stop the program.

The idea behind making this quiz was to help you memorise words through spaced repetition.

To use it, you simply put the word you are trying to memorise, as well as its definition, into 
the category it belongs (noun, verb, or adjective), like so:

'word':'definition of word',

Do not forget the comma (unless it is the last word in the section (followed by "}").

I created it while preparing for my least favourite section (Reading) of the Graduate 
Record Examinations (GRE) and also trying to learn Python by using it, so it 
may be a little clunky. But it did help raise my Reading score by about ten points, I 
reckon, so it did its job.
